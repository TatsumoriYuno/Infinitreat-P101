ー Fullscreen: Disabled/Windowed

ー Geometry & Texture Details: Low

### Usage:

0: Download and install autohotkey.

1: Open Pirate101 if it isn't open already and head to an unpopulated area/realm. Changing realms is important for consistency if your connection is unreliable.

2: Head to whatever location you wish to do the glitch from. This shouldn't matter if your PC is anywhere close to decent, but lag does occasionally fuck up the program.

3: Set the pet you wish to raise into the top-left slot of the first page.

4: Run the script by double-clicking it and tab back to pirate.

5: Hit NumpadAdd(the「+」sign on your numpad).

6: Profit.

To stop the program, close the GUI or hold down backslash for ten seconds.

The images within the zip may need to be replaced with your own screenshots.
